# Personal Website

This is my personal website written in TypeScript that showcases my web development skills and experience.

## Installation 

Inside the project directory, 

1) Check Node is up to date and update if needed

### `nvm install`

2) Install dependencies using yarn

### `yarn`

3) Run the app in development mode

### `npm start`

## Check back for updates!

New features are continously being added to this website. I am always striving to improve my personal website design and functionality.
